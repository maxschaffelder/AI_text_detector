More specifically, elections focus on implementing the most supported policy based on the accumulation of individual preferences. However, not everyone focuses on rational reasoning when voting. Instead, some voters follow the theories of rational ignorance and rational irrationality. Rationally ignorant voters will vote on specific issues only when their benefit outweighs their voting cost. This means that they will only go and vote when that action will gain them more utility than the cost of going to vote. Alternatively, voters may also be rationally irrational; they put their beliefs higher than the scientific truth. Therefore, they intentionally decide to remain uninformed as new information may contradict their pre-established beliefs, even if this does more harm to society. Having mentioned this, what does it have to do with people struggling to support the legalization of medical cannabis? I will show that the voting theory of rational ignorance and rational irrationality can be used to understand why the support for the legalization of medical cannabis has struggled to gain traction even if it helps the quality of life by alleviating the symptoms of a lot of patients with chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's (Kim et al., 2019). Imagine living in a country where medicinal marijuana is illegal; thus, you don't have access to the drug for your grandfather with Alzheimer's. You mention your situation to various people; however, in the end, they all say the same thing: 'I don't support nor believe the use of a drug used to get high will help people with chronic diseases'. As an affected family member, you research as you worry about your grandfather's condition. From this, you know that marijuana may help your grandfather's involuntary movements and muscle cramps, and even occasional seizures, symptoms that diminish quality of life of not only the patient but also family and friends. After you tell them this, they still do not agree and disregard your input, but why is that? Firstly, they might not have a direct connection to someone who suffers from a chronic illness. Therefore, they do not suffer the consequences of a loved one's gradually deteriorating physical and mental condition. Supporting a cause, they get no personal benefit from would not gain them any satisfaction or fulfillment. Secondly, most people solely focus on the fact that there already is a legal medication to try and combat the symptoms. They are not willing to support legal marijuana as, for them, marijuana is associated with the negative image of the youth using it to get high for fun. They center their belief that using this drug is terrible as it makes people go into a 'stupid mindless state' and extrapolate this belief to anything related to the drug's use. Therefore, they choose to remain uninformed about the health benefits, which could greatly help certain affected people because of their beliefs about marijuana usage. Their ignorance and irrationality lead to a treatment not being legalized. This leads to those affected not getting the medication that could improve patients' overall well-being and quality of life. People remain ignorant as they are not directly involved and thus do not benefit from supporting the legalization. As well as, they stay irrational as they focus on their one-sided view that 'weed is bad.' Even if getting the facts is practically free. This is what mine and many families have to go through every day, seeing their loved ones not getting the help they could have just because other citizens intentionally choose not to get informed and, in a way, make our lives worse.\"\n",
    "df.iloc[73, 1] = 'Introduction Capital punishment has long caused considerable debate about its morality and effects on criminal behaviour and has given birth to many controversial attitudes. Whereas collective mentality, recently, has been shifting more towards the abolition of the death penalty, it is still widely put to use across the globe in countries like the USA, China and India. While capital punishment has evolved from the French guillotines and the Roman Colosseum, there are still thousands of executions recorded each year that can be prevented.1 As long as it is still in use, it raises the question of whether capital punishment is necessary to create a deterrent and/or serve justice in cases of heinous crimes. In this essay, I will argue that capital punishment is not necessary and should be abolished, regardless of who is accused or the circumstances of the crime. In the first section, I will give a brief overview of the position in favor of the death penalty by focusing on retribution and deterrence. In the second section, I will argue against these two points to justify the abolition of the death penalty. Finally, I will conclude the essay by exploring evidence of Europe which has already abolished the death penalty. Pro Capital Punishment Position Retribution One of the most significant justifications for the death penalty is the concept of retribution. Essentially, retribution means ‘justice’ and whether a murderer ‘deserves’ to die.2 This idea comes from the fundamental religious perspective of ‘an eye for an eye’3 and ‘a life for a life.’ The main idea is that for the most heinous crimes, offenders deserve the worst punishment, the death penalty, and any lesser crime would undermine the value that society places on protecting lives and ultimately, lead to anarchy. Additionally, the execution of a murderer would provide closure to the victim’s family and comfort that the accused is unable to murder again.4 Furthermore, retribution has always been a vital factor forming the foundation of our criminal justice system and is “one of several acceptable bases for the death penalty”5 according to the Supreme Court. Ultimately, the goal of retribution is to restore balance in society in a ‘just’ manner which forms the basis of support for the death penalty. Deterrence Another notable justification for capital punishment is deterrence. Deterrence refers to punishing a past offender to the extent that a significant number of people are discouraged from committing heinous crimes that they would have committed otherwise because they are afraid 1 Amnesty International. Why Amnesty opposes the death penalty without exception. Death Penalty <https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/> 2 Death Penalty Curriculum. About the death penalty. Death Penalty. <https://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/index.html> 3 \"An eye for an eye\" or the law of retaliation is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree by the injured party. 4 Death Penalty Curriculum. About the death penalty. Death Penalty. <https://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/index.html> 5 Streib, V. (2009). Classic arguments for and against the death penalty. Elon Law Review. 3(1) of receiving a harsh punishment.6 This goes back to the idea that what people fear most is likely to deter most. Therefore, it logically follows that the death penalty is the form of punishment that causes the most deterrence since people fear death above all and, therefore, contributes most to a safer society. Additionally, the death penalty ‘deters’ the murderer who is executed since he/she will not be able to murder again, which, strictly speaking, is a form of incapacitation7. Overall, the goal of deterrence is to prevent future murders by making the punishment so severe (death penalty) that it will make potential murderers reconsider and too afraid to commit any heinous crimes. While taking both retribution and deterrence into account and being aware of the pro capital punishment position, I do not agree that these reasons are sufficient to justify imposing the death penalty since there are various ethical, legal and psychological factors that come into play which I will address in the next section. Anti Capital Punishment Arguments Retribution is Wrong There are several reasons why the idea of retribution is flawed and why the death penalty is not a just response for the taking of a life. Ethically speaking, the concept and practice of retribution can be compared to vengeance and devalues human life by violating the fundamental right to live that is shared by everyone, even murderers.8 As a society, it is unacceptable that a vital part of our criminal justice system is motivated by an idea that resembles vengeance, rather, our criminal justice system should lead us to higher principles that demonstrate a complete respect for human life. Therefore, the death penalty breaches human rights, in particular, “the right to life and the right to live free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”9 Both of these rights are protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN in 1948.10 Furthermore, the death penalty is unique in that crimes other than murder do not receive a punishment that mimics the crime.11 For example, rapists are not punished by sexual assault. On top of that, Camus and Dostoevsky both argued that the crime is mismatched to the punishment in the case of the death penalty since it delivers a ‘double punishment’, the execution and the preceding wait, which is a staggering average of ten years in the USA.12 Additionally, the risk of executing an innocent person poses a problem for the retribution argument since it threatens the key principles of retribution, that people should face what they eserve. In the USA alone, more than 160 prisoners sent to death row, since 1973, have been exonerated or released from death row on grounds of innocence.13 Related to this point is the discriminatory nature of the death penalty since it is disproportionally carried out on people belonging to a certain minority and people with less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds.14 For example, less privileged people have limited access to legal representation and might fall victim to discrimination. Overall, it becomes clear that it is problematic to attempt to justify the death penalty with the retribution argument since serious ethical complications arise relating to the value of human life and the fair distribution of justice. Deterrence is Ineffective The argument that the death penalty is necessary to create a deterrent is invalid since there is no proof that the death penalty is more effective in reducing crime than life imprisonment. The deterrence argument assumes that a potential murderer will (1) believe that he/she will be caught and convicted, (2) assume that he/she will fall within the one percent of convicted murderers who are actually executed and (3) engage in this cost/benefit analysis before acting out.15 Additionally, many murders are committed in moments of intense emotion, like passion or anger, and by criminals who have abused substances and acted impulsively. When considering these factors, it becomes less likely that criminals actively decide not to commit a heinous crime because of the death penalty. In fact, States in the USA that do not employ the death penalty generally have lower murder rates than States that do. The same is true when comparing the USA to Europe and Canada.16 In general, while it is exceptionally difficult to measure the deterrent effect of a punishment in a rigorous way, there is a general consensus among social scientists that the deterrent effects of the death penalty are, at best, unproven. Moreover, the Ehrlich studies17, which have preached the deterrent effects of capital punishment since 1975, have been widely discredited.18 In any event, the fear to spend the rest of one’s life in imprisonment seems more than enough to create a deterrent effect. As a matter of fact, there is some empirical research that the murder rate increases following an execution. This is known as the ‘brutalization effect’19 and proposes that the death penalty stimulates more murders than would normally occur. This is because the death penalty ‘brutalizes’ society by diminishing respect for life in general and demonstrating how our leaders intentionally take lives.'\n",
    "df.iloc[91, 1] = \"Fascism - the appeal of sado-masochism and the authoritarian personality to the lower middle class Some say that history repeats itself but one could also argue that there are certain patterns and tendencies in our human nature that are reflected in our social and political system. The rise of fascism is a topic that already the thinkers of the Frankfurt School were concerned with, in retrospect to Hitler’s authoritarian leadership. Their theories are still relevant to this day when considering the US elections in 2016 but also in the European sphere when for instance looking at Viktor Orbán in Hungary. Both Adorno and Fromm inspected this phenomenon more closely and identified patterns in the leader, the followers, and the victims of such movements which are not to be separated from the ideology itself. History might repeat itself but we can also learn from it so let’s take a closer look at some underlying patterns that can be observed. The lower middle class, also referred to as the “petit-bourgeoisie” was especially hit by the events following the First World War. Fromm identifies both psychological and economical factors that play into their submission to the hierarchical system under Hitler. The lower middle class was always driven by the idea of liberalism, striving to continuously climb up the social ladder to eventually become economically independent. Their social prestige above the working class and striving towards the upper class were significant factors. With the economic depression in 1929, their earned savings were worthless which resulted in frustration and alienation from the system with which they no longer identified but on the other hand, they needed an authority that gave them security. With the decline of economic standard, the gap to the working class became more narrow which fueled the fear of losing privileges and superiority over the working class. They felt the love for the strong and hatred of the weak and unknown which was triggered by this loss of social prestige accompanied by the fear of ending up on the weaker end. This tendency can be further explained by the term “sado-masochism” which describes a person longing to be part of a power structure in which one submits to a higher authority while simultaneously asserting power over another group. In sadism, this strong power allows its follower to lose themself in the greatness of their strength and to be guided. The individual seeks dependency and partaking in something greater in order to overcome their own inferiority. Nazis saw themselves as acting according to nature’s will, in which the horrendous acts were rather a duty to fulfill than a chosen crime. At the same time, they have the sadistic drive to project their own weakness on the victim. Here, the followers of the Nazi regime acted with the thought of unrestricted power over other nations and groups such as the Jews. These sado-masochistic tendencies especially thrived under Hitler and his authoritarian personality. Adorno describes the authoritarian personality as the opposite of someone who behaves in a mature manner. Parallels can be drawn metaphorically to the loss of a father figure and the longing for something similar which replaces this authoritarian guidance. Characteristics such as stereotypical, superstitious, and destructive thinking patterns are particular for this trait and anyone or anything that does not fit into these conventional categories is feared and must be demolished. Deep within, an authoritarian personality has a miserable life because they are so dependent on a symbiotic relationship with others to free them from their lonesomeness. It is almost like a self-destructive trait of constantly fearing away from one’s own fear of being alone by submitting to a larger entity in search of guidance. This bond with another does not require reason but rather exists for the sake of the bond itself. All of these characteristics can be found in authoritarian leaders such as Hitler and in the larger hierarchical structure, he built around his ideology. He was well aware that the lower middle class would be in a vulnerable state and therefore submissive to his leadership and he knew whom to blame as the scapegoat. He learned to master this mess and restructured it into a power dynamic that benefitted his objective to assert dominance over some, yet fulfilling the submissive tasks of something greater and beyond his control. Essay II - Habermas, Fraser, and the Public Sphere Jürgen Habermas was part of the second generation of the Frankfurt School and was especially interested in exploring the conceptualization of the public sphere, looking at how it had developed from the 18th century which he further elaborates on in his piece “Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit” in 1962. He mainly talks about the “bourgeois public spheres” which arose from the deliberation of the monarchy into a more rational, and autonomous society fueled by critical discourse. He would later be criticized for this rather narrow outlook on the public. Habermas argues that anything concerning the public and the general organization of the coexistence in an intertwined society can be considered as public sphere. It is made up of several institutions, and physical spaces in which people can come together, but also virtual spaces begin to contribute to this public discourse. Habermas sees the private sphere as a counterpart to the public sphere. Within the private sphere, the public, meaning the state and society, are not supposed to interfere and it is focussed around the autonomous individual itself rather than the societal structures. This space is a separated space, for instance, the home or the realm of the family which also means that this sphere was not a space for political discussions and the questioning of norms in society. Yet again, this is what makes the public sphere so significant for the process of forming an opinion. Habermas sees the public sphere as something essential within a democratic system since it allows the citizens to exchange their public opinion and actively participate in the social life. The public sphere is a mediating, mobilizing, and democratizing entity between the institution of the government and its citizens. He idealizes the representative function of the public sphere in a way that makes it inclusive of everyone, egalitarian, with an emancipatory function. Therefore, it should not matter who says something but rather about the argument itself. Generally speaking, language plays a significant role in Habermas’ theory with the main goal being mutual understanding and coming to a consensus among each other on critical topics. Looking at Habermas’ theory from a contemporary perspective, one can observe that in practice the public sphere is not so inclusive and egalitarian after all. Mass media has turned virtual spaces into a means of consumption in which the expression of opinions is altered by algorithms. The line between the public and the private sphere has faded. In a recent opinion piece, the feminist philosopher Nancy Fraser “rethinks” Habermas’ theory and identifies shortcomings that are important to consider within the use of critical social theory especially with regards to restructuring the public sphere within our capitalist society. Firstly, she points out the development of “subaltern counterpublics”, formed by marginalized now repressing the individual’s human nature - one could argue that we find ourselves in a cycle of self-destruction. But let’s take a few steps back and consider the link between enlightenment and the cultural industry. The cultural industry is concerned with producing the products of our leisure time from Disney movies to the daily news. It has emerged within our capitalist world through industrialization, globalization, and digitalization. Through enlightenment, not only human nature itself has been disenchanted but also the nature of art has transformed. Before, art was not created for the masses to consume but rather as something unique and distant, created for religious authorities. With the introduction of technology and the frame of the capitalist system, our perception of art and creative expression has altered. Art is reproducible, it is less authentic because it is meant to appeal to the masses, and hence it is less intimate. Art can be seen as representative of the culture industry. An artist is not encouraged to pursue their individuality in creativity anymore because there is the risk of not appealing to the status quo. Culture is made to suit the consumer’s interest but on the other hand, the consumer’s desires are formed by the culture industry and are therefore not individually motivated. Hence, the individual consumer becomes similar to the masses and therefore the supply responds to the consumer’s demand and so it continues. In order to become aware of our alienation from consumption which we experience within the culture industry, we first have to look at the alienation from work. According to Marx, everything an individual works for is a contribution to a world outside of them which they do not necessarily belong to since they are alienated from the product they are creating because it is owned by someone else. In capitalism, the worker functions as a means to the end of profit. Furthermore, this alienation continues in our leisure time because it equally regulates our consumption since our desires are yet again determined by capitalism. The productive workers are forced to become passive consumers rather than individual creators. Adorno and Horkheimer drew the conclusion that the culture industry and capitalism are not only controlling our economic behavior but also our psychological desires and needs. To end this train of thought on a “lighter” note, the Fankfurt School is known for their very critical and theoretical approach to capitalism and the culture industry and it would be narrow-minded to only consider the negative aspects of this system. On the other hand, I would like to point out that capitalism, money, and everything else seemingly dominating our society nowadays is after all a human-made construct in which we tend to feel trapped in. Only rational humans that have a sense of individuality, as well as a sense of equality, will be able to reverse this instrumentalization of our human nature for the better.\"\n",
    "df.iloc[92, 1] = \"In the following, I aim to connect the movement of Enlightenment and the actions following up on this idea to the cultural industry which is governed by our contemporary capitalist society. I will include the critiques of the two main thinkers of the Frankfurt School, Adorno and Horkheimer, who focus on the Dialectic of Enlightenment and how this dialectic is entangled with the overarching phenomenon of alienation. This was first introduced by Marx and is still present in our daily lives as consuming individuals being part of today’s mass culture. It is important to mention beforehand that all of these complex concepts are interconnected somehow and therefore also influence one another. The “Age of Enlightenment” was an idea that flourished at the beginning of the 18th Century through philosophers like Kant. This philosophical idea was further realized during the course of the French Revolution in which the people took power and hence authority into their own hands. Religious leaders, namely the monarchy, were no longer accepted as the higher entity that had claimed to possess the god-given power and authority over the people. With the enlightenment, human reason became the highest authority and academics were convinced that this rationality and thinking for ourselves would quite literally enlighten a dark room that has been kept in the dark by authorities preaching a mythical worldview in order to keep the masses controlled. Looking at it from this perspective, reason and mythology seem like two opposing concepts and the enlightenment of society is what seems to be the reasonable thing to argue for. Two main thinkers of the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer, and Adorno, view this movement rather critically and argue that reason and mythology are not so indifferent from each other after all and therefore also complement each other rather than oppose one another. It is important to mention that the Horkheimer and Adorno are not opposed to the idea of enlightenment in itself but rather critiquing how humankind has realized this literal enlightenment in every aspect of life to an extent that perhaps even over rationalizes the human reason. In their critique, they shed light on the dialectic within enlightenment. The word “dialectic” already implies that one cannot understand a concept without also regarding its opposite. Reason can be used in an irrational manner - or rather be abused. Early on, thinkers of the Frankfurt School emphasized that scientists are not value-neutral, and sciences can also be instrumentalized. This then is the instrumentalization of reason itself. The ultimate goal of enlightenment was to liberate humans from a mystified world. This entailed the demystification of nature which is the unknown and therefore the uncontrolled. A rational being strives to conquer the unknown and this unknown is also part of our human nature. With the movement of enlightenment, the focus shifted away from the mystified unknown of the individual, to the individual becoming something that can be completely rationalized. Once a human is seen as this rational entity it can be instrumentalized in a bigger system in which it then functions as one small drill in a machinary. Within the capitalist system we currently live in, humans cannot merely exist anymore just for the sake of existing. Humans are expected to function as means to an end - we are the useful means serving the end goal of utility in a bigger system. The main conclusion to be drawn from thid is that enlightenment through reason was an initial push towards emancipation but the idea of the authority of reason has been instrumentalized and is But let’s take a few steps back and consider the link between enlightenment and the cultural industry.

    "df.iloc[93, 1] = \"This essay will discuss the compatibility of being a good friend while also committing to act-utilitarianism and possible conflicts that could occur. Consequently, the concept of act-utilitarianism in itself will be questioned with its guiding principle of utility. In simpler terms, in a moral dilemma, one would have to choose between being a good friend and being a good moral agent according to act utilitarianism and therefore doing whatever results in the best outcome for the greater amount. Before presenting my argumentation, I will define some key terms relevant to this debate. According to J.S. Mill, we should strive to “produce the greatest overall balance of happiness over misery” (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 123). Secondly, when talking about “good friend” this applies to an “end friendship” in which the other person is treated as an end and not as a mere means (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 176). The friend is valued for their unique character and therefore cannot be substituted (Kapur, 1991, 483). While utilitarianism is a “doctrine for impartiality” (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 127), being a good friend is based on partial actions and motivated by love. To display the difference between the action of a good friend and the action of a good moral agent, I adjusted Williams’ “drowning wife” (Williams, 1976, 18) to the “drowning friend” example which goes as follows. One finds themself in the moral dilemma of choosing between saving a friend’s life or two stranger’s lives. An act-utilitarian would save the two strangers because their death would cause a greater amount of misery. A moral agent would strive to achieve overall more happiness than misery and therefore save two lives rather than one. Since everyone’s happiness is equally important, the resulting misery for the friend in the moral dilemma is outweighed by the greater amount of happiness that was achieved by him saving the two other people. Consequently, the agent would act in an impartial manner as a good moral agent but not as a good friend. If one was a good friend, one would act in a partial manner. According to Williams, every human being has categorical desires which give reasons for living and purpose in life and which are the essence of their character. In this situation, one’s categorical desire would be to share one’s life with their friend. Since self-preservation is the normative force of love, one would choose to save the friend because giving up on them would mean giving up on one’s desire and therefore on their life (Williams, 1976, 14). Consequently, one would not guide their actions according to the principles of act-utilitarianism because misery is outweighing the happiness achieved in this since the two other people drowned. A good friend would rather act with the intention of keeping their friend which is a universalizable action and therefore morally acceptable (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 165). Resulting from this, being a good friend is incompatible with being a good moral agent following act-utilitarianism. The principle of act-utilitarianism does not regard a human’s need for categorical desires which is substantial for their existence. It expects the moral agent to act against their character by disregarding their own happiness if a greater amount of happiness can be achieved by different means. Thus, we should not accept act-utilitarianism.\"\n",

Imagine following moral dilemma; the car cannot be stopped and has to decide whether to save the two people in the car but kill a child on the street or to draw aside and therefore save the child but kill the passengers in the car. We can see a conflict between the utilitarian theory and the deontological approach arising. In the trolley problem, most people choose act utilitarianism and would push one person under a trolley to save the five which would mean saving the greatest number of people and therefore achieving the greatest amount of overall well-being. According to utilitarianism, this the morally right thing to do (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 123). A deontologist, on the other hand, would choose to not push the one person under a trolley but why is that? Deontology follows the theory that the moral rightness of an action depends on its intention and not on its outcome. The question is therefore not about how many people dye but rather about why or why not one should push an innocent person under the trolley. The reasoning behind a deontologist choosing not to push someone can be explained through the principle of universalizability and the principle of humanity. These principles are the basis of Kantian Ethics. According to Kant, “every action has a maxim” (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 164) and whether this maxim is good or bad depends on its universalizability. Applying this principle to our moral dilemma, first, one has to determine what they do and why they do it. In this case, the moral agent chooses NOT to push the person because this person is innocent, and killing someone innocent is morally wrong. Secondly, one imagines a world in which everyone would act upon this maxim. Thus, choosing not to push an innocent person. Lastly, one confirms that the goal of this action, which is to save this innocent person’s life, can be achieved in such a world. Since all of these questions apply, this maxim is universalizable (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 165). The principle of humanity entails that we always ought “to treat human beings as an end, and never as mere means” (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 176). If the moral agent would push the person under the trolley, they would use them in order to save the five people and thus use them as a means to achieve a goal. The person would not be treated with the respect they deserve as a human being. Following Kant, humans are valuable because they are “autonomous and rational” (Shafer-Landau, 2020, 179) beings and therefore deserve to be treated with respect. Overall, the deontologist’s reasoning behind not pushing one innocent person is coherent. The argument is substantiated by the two main principles of Kantian ethics which are the principle of universalizability and the principle of humanity. Both the utilitarian and the deontological approach have logical premises that need to be further evaluated in order to apply them to current issues such as the development of self-driving cars. However, the action of a deontological moral agent proves to be morally right.\"\n",
    "df.iloc[95, 1] = \"The following essay will compare Rawls’ public reason to Rousseau’s idea of the general will. Both concepts aim at increasing the people’s participation in decision-making but have a different understanding of how the demos is conceptualized. Their ideas have to be regarded in the respective historical context and serve as a relevant base for today’s liberal democracies and public discourse. Firstly, Rawl’s public reason is a core element of political liberalism and aims at achieving stability in society. Stability means that the reasonable citizens willingly abide by the laws which were enforced by the government. Public reason demands that the citizens need to be able to justify their political decision to one another by using publicly available values and standards. An argument should therefore be generic and accessible to anyone, no matter their personal comprehensive doctrine. Thus, Rawls assumes the citizen to be a rational actor that shall sacrifice individualism in order to reach a consensus. Similarly, Rousseau’s idea of the general will gives the power to the populace who create laws for everyone, by everyone. The general will are policies that are ideally in the interest of all members of society and should essentially have the goal of the common good. A decision therefore cannot be motivated by personal interest. Rousseau is in favor of direct democracy, meaning that all citizens participate in general assemblies in which they vote on proposed legislation. Therefore the demos’ high level of education and deep care for each other is essential to inform policy-making. The government is solely responsible for executing the policies. Both concepts aim at giving power to the people in terms of decision-making. However, “the people” do not always include everyone. Considering the historical context in which the general will evolved, the demos did not include women, the less fortunate, or other minority groups in society and therefore disregards the pluralism of ideas and morals. Also, Rawls’ concept of public reason only allows for censored pluralism. He acknowledges all individuals to be part of the demos but under the condition that they put their personal belief systems aside. One is therefore only considered to be a reasonable citizen as long they do not reason according to their comprehensive doctrine but based on public political culture. Both ideas preach egalitarianism and the necessity for participation but are flawed in their implementation. Nevertheless, both theories offer valid ideas that should be core elements of political discourse such as a well-educated and informed public, room for debate and an accessible public sphere for instance during general assemblies, and open communication with the governing body. The question remains, whether moral and religious ideas are key to critical public discourse and a fruitful debate. I would argue, that our belief system highly influences our life as active citizens and therefore should be regarded in policy-making. This for instance becomes relevant when considering current debates about abortion rights. Individualism and freedom should not be at the expense of a seemingly pluralistic society. Public discourse is responsible for creating this room for disagreement and complexity rather than simplicity. Decision-making as this may be more time-consuming but it is essential that everyone affected by a decision also has a say in it (Habermas). Reaching consensus is complex but after all, the essential part of liberal democracy is that everyone has the right to take part in the deliberation process and even if opinions are temporarily not reflected in policies, they are nevertheless protected and valid. Yasha Mounk identifies a number of contemporary problems of liberal democracy and also offers solutions on how to tackle them. Additionally, the author David van Reybrouck came up with remedies for the problems of democracy. In the following, I will outline both approaches and then provide some personal insights into the topic. Mounk names four solutions that could tackle conditions of our democracy that are put to a test in the chaotic present. Namely, these changing conditions are stagnant living standards that make citizens anxious about the future, an increased heterogeneity of society which adds to the complexity of facets, and lastly the rise of the internet (social media) leading to an overwhelming amount of unfiltered information and opinions. Mounk is of the opinion that our economic policies require reform in order to temper inequality and guarantee a certain living standard for everyone, especially in the long run. A dissatisfied society would eventually lead to revolts against the system. Secondly, Mounk emphasizes the necessity for rethinking our understanding of membership and a general sense of belonging to for instance a nation. We need to treat citizens as individuals rather than link them to stereotypes and prejudice. This will help us in tackling common goals such as the climate crisis. Thirdly, we need to start a discussion on finding a balance between freedom of speech and censorship in our digital world as it poses a threat to democracy. Last but certainly not least, education on the virtues of democracy is key which nicely links to van Reybrouck’s ideal of the informed citizen. Generally, van Reybrouck finds citizen participation to be the key to solving the contemporary problems of democracy. The government hence has the responsibility to systematically facilitate the contribution of all citizens since the oppression and inequality also arise from disadvantages created by the system and its institutions. This also includes deconstructing power structures that currently exclude members of society from taking part in political discourse. Individuals who have to work several jobs in order to provide for themselves simply do not have the resources and capacities to additionally engage in public discourse and therefore are excluded from the “elite” which the author refers to as “professional citizens”. Van Reybrouck proposes the deliberative project which includes members representative of the larger population who are as informed as possible. This group of people should be diverse and have a relevant contribution to the final decision. Van Reybrouck argues that this form of citizen participation would increase the government’s legitimacy and stability. On the other hand, these processes can be very lengthy and might not reach consensus but nevertheless made an effort to implement pluralism towards an equal society in which every voice matters. Adding on to these progressive ideas, I would like to put an emphasis on gender equality in these referendums. The public sphere is ideally inclusive and accessible to anyone. In reality, it is still based on structures that systematically put members of society in a disadvantaged position as mentioned by van Reybrouck. There is an imbalance in female representatives in political positions which are linked to a missing focus on combining this work environment with a family. In our democracies, we need to focus on providing child care, compensation, and most importantly changing socialization in favor of working mothers. A mother can simply not attend a referendum held in the evening because her child has to be taken care of. Secondly, I would like to argue for problem-solving on a local level. In my opinion, our democracy is facing overwhelmingly complex and big problems that can quickly lead to numbness on the citizen level. Therefore, local authorities should engage with small groups and listen to their concerns and ideas. Instead of trying to achieve overarching consensus on a national level which often leads to a lack of decisions, in the long run, freedom should be given to the citizens who know their needs best. This will continuously keep them integrated into the public discourse and will set incentives for also taking part in larger decisions since they perceive democracy as a daily practice, right, and privilege. The demos are at the core of our liberal democracy and therefore essential for its survival.\"\n",
    "df.iloc[96, 1] = \"Systems and theories provide structures for our understanding and perception of reality and rules that serve as guidelines. They facilitate periods of order and equilibrium in an otherwise uncertain world. In science, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn refers to this interval as normal science, a state in which the scientific community agrees on an established paradigm. With every harmonious state, chaos as its inevitable opposite arises. Balance within a system is comparable to a pendulum that swings from one side to the other creating a stable state. Kuhn refers to disruptions in science as anomalies that push the system into a state between order and chaos. Returning to the analogy of the pendulum, it will always seek equilibrium and therefore strive for a structure provided by one paradigm in the normal science. However, this chaos is a necessity for change to occur within a system. “Development and progress are processes resulting from movements between order, stability and equilibrium, and chaos, imbalance and uncertainty” (De Roo & Voogd, 2021, 59). This essay will further explore how the problem of incommensurability is linked to this change and eventually can lead to progress. According to Kuhn, the existence of incommensurability is limiting scientific progress rather than promoting it. Arguing against this claim, I will provide an elaborate introduction to how Kuhn regards science and illustrate how incommensurability contributes meaningfully to its progression. I will then explore Kuhn’s reasoning behind his claim, discussing the three main components of incommensurability: changes in standards, conceptual changes, and world change and arguing for the necessity to acknowledge and incorporate incommensurability for meaningful scientific progress. Science has an intrinsically progressive nature but the question remains on how this progress can be measured (Niiniluoto, 1980, 427). The range between order and chaos can be applied here. An essential question is whether science is progressing between two different paradigms. Traditional science was long assumed to progress linearly. Kuhn compared scientific progress to biological evolutions in the sense that they are both not aiming at one fixed goal, but also that they are both driven by anomalies that differ from the norm and thereby question the established standards, pushing toward a selection. Kuhn does not view science as a linear progression in which one element follows another but rather as a cycle (Figure II: Kuhn Cycle) leading to a branching rather than a linear progression (Oberheim & Hoyningen-Huene, 2018). The Kuhn Cycle is comparable to the shift between order and chaos. In order to understand Kuhn’s critical view on the progression of science, grasping his theoretical base for the nature of science is important. Generally, a paradigm can be understood as a set of implicit rules that refer to the what and the how hence the standards of a paradigm. The what refers to which theories and ideas the paradigm is concerned with and the how meaning methods that determine means of measurement and interpretation - essentially how reality is perceived. The scientific community regards the paradigm as the norm. It is important to note here that a paradigm becomes relevant and meaningful because we ascribe meaning to it. This agreed reality comes into question when an accumulation of anomalies arises. Kuhn describes an anomaly as a “puzzle that has resisted solution” (Godfrey-Smith, 2021, 82). Considering the pendulum, the paradigm will aim to resolve the occurring anomalies in the state of crisis to return to equilibrium but if it fails to do so, a scientific revolution will emerge. “Without a crisis, scientists will not have any motivation to consider radical change” (Godfrey-Smith, 2021, 88). Paradigm B is significantly different from Paradigm A since a paradigm shift is comparable to entering a new reality and this is the point where the problem of incommensurability enters the discussion. Can we make the claim that the two paradigms differ from one another if they are not comparable in the first place? Kuhn addresses this concern in his work “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” (1962) and further refines his criticism in the following decades. The term “incommensurability” means to have no common measure (Oberheim & Hoyningen-Huene, 2018). Kuhn identified three main aspects in which two paradigms are incommensurable with one another and hence it gets difficult to measure scientific progress by comparable means. The philosopher firstly discusses the changes in problems and standards, furthermore, the conceptual change, and lastly, he goes as far as to describe the normal science period which emerged after a scientific revolution as a new world. Kuhn’s reasoning will further be explored and discussed below.I. Changes in Standards According to Kuhn, with a paradigm shift, not only the “what”, meaning the theories and ideas of a paradigm shift but also the “how”, which refers to the standards that essentially allow the sense-making of data. As soon as data is interpreted and analyzed, measures are applied and therefore assign a certain meaning to the data. This occurs when one sees the data through the lens of a paradigm. In fact, already the data collection process is guided by the paradigm, therefore only the data itself before it is identified as data is universal. Everything from there onwards is linked to the standards established and generally accepted by one paradigm. Kuhn argues, that there is no such thing as universal standards that we can use to generally grasp two paradigms at the same time. An analogy for this dilemma is a political revolution from one regime to the overtaking one also referred to as a “coup d’état”. During the period of crisis, there is no defined concept of legality and it is unclear what is considered legal or illegal. Once the previous government is overthrown, legality may be completely redefined and take on a different role in society. Returning to standards in science, this also refers to what is considered “good science” within the paradigms. Again, there is no universal measure for what is regarded as good evidence or a good argument (Godfrey-Smith, 2021, 92). Considering Kuhn’s argument of incommensurability of standards, it makes it impossible to judge Paradigm B as inherently better simply because it was established after Paradigm A. Kuhn, therefore, argues that it is impossible to draw the conclusion that scientific progress has successfully been achieved. However, as mentioned before, scientific progress is not measured linearly. I would like to draw attention to the matter that Paradigm A was insufficient in resolving anomalies that challenge the paradigm and hence a crisis had occurred. Whether or not Paradigm B is the “better” alternative to explain reality should not be the question but rather that Paradigm A was not able to explain reality in the context it was set in. As movement is essential to resolve chaos and restore order, change is inevitable and one must not forget that another crisis is already starting to accumulate. To conclude, the success of scientific progress should be linked to whether there are periods of crisis rather than trying to measure the incommensurable states of normal science (Paradigm A vs. Paradigm B). II. Conceptual Changes There is not only a change in standards but also a conceptual change during a paradigm shift. Paradigm B following Paradigm A may adopt certain terminology but attach a completely different meaning to the terms. A common example in scientific history is the use of the term “mass”. While Newton is referring to something that is constant and absolute and mass is linked to what is described as having mass, Einstein describes mass relative to its frame of reference. According to Einstein, mass increases as it approaches the speed of light. The same term is used within different paradigms and has different meanings (Oberheim & Hoyningen-Huene, 2018). Kuhn, therefore, argues that scientists from two different paradigms might be using the same words but speak a different language and cross-paradigm communication would therefore not lead to a meaningful dialogue. In his later works, Kuhn discussed possible solutions to overcome this problem. According to Kuhn, incommensurability makes translation or the ideal of a universal language impossible but this does not “undermine understanding across language barriers” (Weaver & Gioia, 1994, 573). For instance, statements made in the past can only fully be understood when considering the historical context and by setting aside our current conceptions of reality. What complicates the conscious act of language learning is that one has to be aware of the plurality of languages in the first place which leads the discussion to the last and most complex problem of incommensurability. III. World Change As paradigms are essential for sense-making and “how” and “what” of one’s perception, a paradigm shift consequently largely influences reality. Following a change of tradition, a scientist enters a whole new world and “he must learn to see a new Gestalt” (Kuhn, 1970, 112). Kuhn makes use of the psychological phenomenon “Gestalt Switch” which is shown in Figure III. The image suggests that one either sees a rabbit or a duck but cannot perceive both animals at the same time. After a gestalt switch has happened, one cannot reason nor conceptualize within the old paradigm but perceives the world from the acquired paradigm. This also refers to the point that scientists from two paradigms might refer to the same data which is the image of the duck and the rabbit in this case but due to the context of the paradigm, the data is interpreted differently as described in conceptual changes. This shows that one cannot view the data objectively because it is always embedded in the conceptual standards of a paradigm. For example (Figure IV), Copernicus’ theory stands in conflict with Ptolemy’s theory with regard to the arrangement of the solar system. Ptolemy sees the earth at the centre of the universe and other planets including the sun revolve around it. Contrasting, Copernican theory states that planets orbit the sun which is essentially the centre of the universe (Oberheim & Hoyningen-Huene, 2018). This quite literally suggests two worldviews in terms of the positioning of the world in the universe and this can be seen symbolically in what Kuhn calls world change. One has to reject Ptolemy’s theory in order to understand Copernicus’ approach and both paradigms cannot coexist in one “world”. Once a scientist has committed to a paradigm, it shapes their worldview. The problem of world change suggests a singularity and thereby out rules the existence of plurality. However, a plurality of paradigms is an essential base for daring to consider scientific progress. With Kuhn’s argument in mind that normal science is a phase of stability and order, scientists within a paradigm are not exempt from realizing that anomalies are arising. They know, that with the existence of order, there comes the inevitable opposite which is chaos (Figure I). Due to this awareness of chaos, crises are considered a possibility that can occur even if the current state is structured. Science is not one-dimensional. When discussing non-linearity, one should not only consider linearity in a temporal context by looking at the past, present and future. One needs to take the possible dimensions that are already coexisting in the present into account which suggests a branching structure rather than a linear structure of science. This existence of chaos suggests plurality. Someone that can consider the plurality of paradigms can make sense of the idea of scientific progress beyond one’s paradigm which defines normal science. Conclusion It is indisputable that incommensurability poses a complex problem to scientific progress and hence, how we make sense of the world which is essentially the goal of science. Nevertheless, incommensurability and its three main components do not restrain science from progressing. According to Kuhn, there is progress in normal science but “within revolutionary science it is very hard to tell” (Godfrey-Smith, 2021, 78). Considering the existence of chaos in science as the antagonist to order, we can derive the fact that science is somewhat progressing but we are unable to conclude how that is. Incommensurability is a logical outcome resulting from scientific progress because with shifting paradigms, methods and standards essentially have to change in order to resolve anomalies that the previous paradigm was unable to solve. Commensurability between paradigms would slow down scientific progress in the bigger picture because similar mistakes would be repeated instead of rebuilding the entire approach to the presented data which eventually offers a novel outlook on the world. The changing components of science can be bridged by language learning rather than translating and meaningful dialogue between paradigms can be achieved (Weaver & Gioia, 1994, 565). We require critical minds that recognize the phase of normal science as stable yet not as constant and that embrace the uncertainty of chaos, allowing for the plurality of paradigms. Incommensurability itself is an existing proof of scientific progress if we allow ourselves to regard progress as a development rather than a linear growth. The search for equilibrium requires movement, not stillness, between order and chaos.\"\n",
    "df.iloc[97, 1] = \"Institutional frameworks as a key to equal distribution at home and on the labor market? Although we are living in the 21st Century, traditional gender roles are still dominating our daily life. While women are building their careers, they are also expected to invest in their family, especially during the upbringing of a child which leads to a double burden. An increased division of labor and therefore more father-involvement would allow the woman to focus more on her career. Additionally, it would have a positive impact on the child’s perception of gender roles and their later life choices in general. The parental leave policies in Sweden highly encourage a family-work balance. Are institutional frameworks the key to more equal distribution both at home and on the labor market? This question will be discussed in the following using the example of parental leave policies in Sweden. First, I would like to further elaborate on the issue of the female double-burden itself. Over the past decades, women have increasingly participated in the labor market and have distanced themselves from being reduced to their role as a “homemaker”. However, this increased participation has not been accompanied by a similar rise in men’s involvement in household tasks (Blossfeld et al., 2015, 19). Women find themselves therefore in the position to choose between family and career or to manage both at the same time. The researcher Eccles studied women’s occupational choices and argues that complex choices, such as career, are not made in isolation of other life choices” (Eccles, 1994, 591). Thus, family-policies enforced by the government would contribute to making family and career more compatible. These frameworks would encourage society to question traditional gender norms and project a more egalitarian image. Adding to this, a study conducted by the Swedish sociologists Edlund and Öun shows that “a country's politico-institutional framework, in particular, family policy, influences and structures people's preferences about desirable behavior of fathers and mothers” (Edlund & Öun, 2016, 164). Taking Swedish family policies as an example, the country took a first step towards a more egalitarian approach by expanding maternity leave to parental leave in 1974 which encourages the father’s involvement in childcare. Swedish parents can take up to 480 days off and it is up to them to divide this time between each other. However, there is a non-transferable “daddy-month” which requires fathers to either “use it or lose it” (Sarkadi & Wells, 2011, 26) encouraging their involvement in childcare. Edlund’s and Öun’s research show that “about 70%  of the Swedes believe that mothers and fathers should share the parental leave equally” (Edlund & Öun, 2016, 164) which implies that the policies promoting the dual-earner model positively influence the parent’s perception of labor division. However, data shows that the theory of this model is still far away from being realized. Almost every Swedish father takes some parental leave, but mothers take up the majority with 78% of the days (Sarkadi & Wells, 2011, 26). This leads back to several factors. Considering the female perspective, mothers that quickly return back to their workplace are seen as “masculine” or “selfish” and are expected to live up to the social pressure of being a “good mom” (Sarkadi & Wells, 2011, 27). A father on the other hand, who is most likely employed in a male-dominated field, can experience discrimination at his workplace for taking longer parental leave. This brings in the importance of other actors such as employers for the understanding of gender-based division of childcare (Bygren & Duvander, 2006, 363). Therefore, the policy alone is not sufficient. Furthermore, increased father involvement in the rearing of a child does not only positively affect the female participation in the labor market but also the child’s perception of gender roles. The educational psychologist Jaquelynne Eccles developed the “theoretical model of achievement-related choices” (Eccles, 1994, 588) which researches the factors influencing an individual’s life choices. Socializers such as parents and teachers play a significant role in this process. A child growing up in a predominantly traditional household is likely to develop a traditional image of gender roles. If a young girl grows up witnessing her mother’s career achievements, this will positively affect the perception of her own future options. The same goes for a boy that experiences his father as present in their childhood. His gender role perceptions will be influenced by this and will affect his later life choices. To conclude, the issue of the female double burden is one that needs to be recognized and tackled by society in near future. The positive impact of more division of labor within families is seen in both women being more invested in their career and at the same time fathers being more involved in the rearing of their children which again positively impacts the child’s self-perception and their perception of gender roles. Family policies such as Sweden’s approach to parental leave are already a beginning but they are not completely realistic because more factors need to be taken into consideration. One of these factors would for example be acceptance and less judgement in the work environment which requires the employer to be an active actor. It is necessary to mention other crucial institutional frameworks such as childcare facilities in this context but that would go beyond the scope of this essay. Finally, change takes time and does not happen in a short amount of time especially when it comes to an issue that society and politics have not been able to solve ideally so far. Considering an outlook on further research and future developments, it will be interesting to see how the pandemic changes current gender roles and the traditional division of labor. In many family households, both parents are currently present at home. This has an impact on working mothers because it increases their double burden even more taking homeschooling into account. On the other hand, the father is at home as well and automatically has to be more involved. A prediction could possibly be that “these changes are likely to push social norms towards more equality in the provision of childcare and housework” (Alon et al., 2020, 18). Yet again, other actors such as the employer have to adapt to these changes. Future research and investigation will show the impact of corona on labor division and the resulting equality at home and on the labor market.\"\n",
    "df.iloc[101, 1] = \"1. Are different human values compatible? In your answer discuss value pluralism and the thought of Isaiah Berlin. Isaiah Berlin argues in his essay “Two Concepts of Liberty” that our values are often not compatible. He disagrees with the belief of Value-Monism which assumes that there is one single right answer to every value question since it does not capture all values that could possibly exist. Berlin suggests the idea of Value-Pluralism as a system of values that states that there is no right or single right answer to some value questions. This supports his argument that some values are indeed incompatible and in contrast to each other which is considered as conflicting value pluralism (opposite: harmonious value pluralism). It follows, that some value conflicts are rationally irresolvable which refers to strong value-pluralism. Usually, freedom, or in this case liberty had been only considered as one concept. Isaiah Berlin regards liberty as two concepts, essentially negative and positive liberty, meaning the freedom from and the freedom to. Berlin argues that these value conflicts arise because sometimes different values such as liberty and equality cannot be weighed up against each other. They are both relevant and depending on one’s values and moral standing one would argue for the one but not the other. This does not mean that two values necessarily cancel each other out but rather that they are simply sometimes incompatible with one another. Sometimes we do have to way our values against each other and sacrifice one for the other. Here the balance is important. Using the example of liberty and equality, sometimes liberty for instance needs to be restricted in order to ensure equality. This briefly touches upon the concept of positive liberty which suggests that sometimes the state and society can justifiably interfere with an individual’s freedom. The main reason for value pluralism is that we are living in a complex world in which individuals share different values that can be equally significant and relevant as long as they are rational. He says that humans simply disagree on certain things such as: “I prefer coffee, you prefer champagne. There is nothing more to be said.” This is an individual choice that does not need to be discussed any further. He does state that there are certain values that we as humans do share as rational beings. Those kinds of choices are influenced by the environment in which we are raised and resulting from the social influences we experience. There are some moral conflicts that can be easily resolved by looking at them from a rational perspective. On the other hand, Berlin also believes that there are no such things as clearly morally wrong or right. Sometimes value conflicts arise that are irresolvable and in which different values are incompatible. Concluding, liberty, and equality are sometimes incompatible or at least restrict one another. It depends on the society and generally the circumstances of the system in which the individuals find themselves. Some people are systematically already given more freedom since they have access to more resources and are therefore more free in their choices. This also shows, that there can be inequalities arising from perceived equal liberty. 2. Is John Rawls’ “Veil of Ignorance” an appropriate device for constructing principles of justice? John Rawls is one of the most important political philosophers of the 20th century and in his work “A Theory of Justice” he proposes a thought experiment that argues for justice as fairness. Rawls suggests, that we should view the structure of our system through the “veil of ignorance” in order to create a just society. It is supposed to give a basic understanding of how social and political institutions should be organized. The experiment touches upon several areas of life such as the legal system, the economy, education, and so on. It goes as follows; he asks the individual to imagine that you knew nothing about where you would end up and what sort of society you would live in. You would be uncertain of your wealth, social status, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical abilities, and your values. Taking all of this into consideration, what kind of society would you want to live in? And which laws should be implemented in this society? Of course, if you were rich you would want economic freedom and if you were poor you would tax the rich but this is not relevant in this case since you could end up on either side of the spectrum. This thought experiment aspires to put people into a mindset in which they are completely free of bias and able to make impartial decisions for everyone’s good. This is called the “original position”, which is considered the only perspective from which one could create a just society. To further visualize this, imagine you were sharing a cake with your sibling, you would try to make one piece bigger than the other for your own benefit and your sibling would do the same. Now imagine, that whoever divides the cake gets whichever piece is left of it. Hence, you would try to divide the cake as equally as possible to ensure that you as much cake as your sibling. This is how the veil of ignorance works. It is important to note, that this concept differs from utilitarianism since it is opposed to creating the greatest good for the greatest number of people but rather good for everyone. According to Rawls, there can only be social and economic inequalities if they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged (difference principle) and if attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. A criticism of the veil of ignorance is that it strips us from all values that we have ever learned and without a sense of values we would not know how to decide. Without knowing what is considered “good”, one would not be able to make rational decisions. Therefore, it is considered the “thin” theory of the good. Parties to the original position only know the need for primary goods, such as liberties, opportunities, wealth, income, and “social bases of self-respect”. On the other hand, the veil of ignorance is as mentioned above is only a hypothetical idea that is extremely unrealistic to realize in an already established system that we live in today. It is unrealistic to simply redistribute resources because there is a reason why they became to be owned in the first place, this is Robert Nozick’s main critique. In order to help us look at everything, we take for granted from a different perspective than our own this is after all a useful thought experiment.\"\n",

We might be quite convinced of the former happening, but why are we so sure of ourselves and is this reasoning justified? To try to find the answer to this, we have to travel back to the 18th century where David Hume has been quarreling with this exact question. What followed were the most famous discussions of induction written by Hume and the well-known problem of induction. This problem has been at the heart of debate over the years and many philosophers have tried their hand at solving it. In this essay, I will specifically focus on Karl Popper who has claimed and has been widely credited as having solved the problem of induction. However, I will argue, with the help of Wesley Salmon, that Popper has actually failed to do so. To show this, I am first going to give an overview of Hume’s problem of induction followed by Popper’s interpretation and proposed solution of it. Then, I will dive deeper into the territories where Popper starts to lose his rationality and consider Salmon’s critique before concluding the essay. Hume’s Problem of Induction Intuitively, we think that observations we make have some power of justification to predict the future. For example, the observation that drinking coffee in the morning thus far gives a boost in energy seems to justify the belief that it will do so in the future and that coffee in general provides the drinker with increased energy. Inferences like this, from the observed to the unobserved, are known as ‘inductive inferences’ (Howson, 2000). When Hume (2019) first formulated the problem of induction in 1739, he noted that inductive inferences directly or indirectly rely on the baseless premise that the future will resemble the past. In order to unpack this statement, Hume distinguishes between two kinds of knowledge; relations of ideas (demonstrative reasoning) and matters of fact (moral reasoning). Relations of ideas are a priori and logically true within themselves, like algebra and geometry, and any denial of such propositions would imply a contradiction. Matters of fact, on the other hand, deal with experience and cannot be disproved solely with the help of logic and reason. Hume (2019) suggests we know matters of fact about unobserved things through cause and effect. My knowledge that the sun will rise tomorrow is based on the experience that it has risen every day in the past. Since there is no contradiction in saying that the sun will not rise, Hume (2019) concludes that our knowledge of cause and effect must be based on experience. This cuts right into the heart of inductive reasoning since it consists of observing and predicting the future based on observations we have done in the past. To be able to use induction as a valid form of reasoning, we need to establish some ‘uniformity principle’ that demonstrates that the future will resemble the past (Hume, 2019). However, we cannot prove this principle through reason since there is no contradiction in the premise that the future will not be like the past, and we cannot prove it through experience, since we cannot observe the future. As a result, we fall into an endless circle of reasoning where we try to justify inductive reasoning with the help of the uniformity principle which, as just discussed, cannot be justified by either reason or experience (Ladyman, 2002). At this point, Hume (2019) accepts the consequences of his reasoning and concludes that induction is not a valid form of reasoning, and, thus, formulates the problem of induction. It is important to note, however, that Hume recognizes induction as a way to build knowledge that comes very naturally to us but this does not change the fact that it is not rationally justified. Popper’s Solution Like Hume, Popper identifies as an inductive skeptic and is often credited with solving the problem of induction. In order to understand how Popper attempts to do this, I will first outline his proposed distinction between science and pseudo-science which Popper termed the problem of demarcation. As a result, Popper proposes ‘falsification’ which claims that “a hypothesis is scientific if and only if it has the potential to be refuted by some possible observation” (Godfrey-Smith, 2021, p. 79). In other words, a scientific hypothesis has to take the risk of being potentially falsified to be scientific. This is why, for example, Popper did not deem Freudian psychoanalysis as scientific, since it is virtually impossible to attempt to disprove Freud’s theories. Popper’s more controversial approach comes with using falsification to solve the problem of induction. According to Popper (2002), all testing in science should attempt to refute theories by means of observation because it is impossible to support the truth of a scientific theory through observational evidence. Relating back to Hume, Popper agrees that induction is an invalid form of reasoning, however, Popper argues that the problem of induction does not prove that scientific knowledge is not justified since science is not reliant on induction in any way (Godfrey-Smith, 2021). Like most philosophers of science, Popper (2002) placed great importance on the idea of fallibilism which states that we can never be completely certain that a certain belief (theory, view, etc.) is true. Therefore, rather than performing science through the use of inductive inferences, Popper proposed the use of the hypothetico-deductive model. Accordingly, the way science proceeds starts with deducing an observational prediction from a proposed theory. Then, through experiments and other ways to test the theory, we observe if the prediction occurs as predicted. If it does not, then we have successfully falsified the theory and if it does, we have not yet falsified the theory (Newton-Smith, 1981). For example, the Eddington experiment designed to test Einstein’s predictions merely failed to falsify them instead of proving Einstein ‘right’. For Popper (2002), we can never make a judgment on if a theory is true or on how likely it is to be true, rather, we should never stop trying to falsify it, no matter how many times it has been tested. However, Popper also recognizes that we have limited time and resources to test theories over and over again, regardless, “we should always retain a tentative attitude toward our theories, no matter how successful they have been in the past” (Godfrey-Smith, 2021, p. 81). Furthermore, to demonstrate Popper’s view, we can explore a hypothetical proposed law of ‘All F’s are G’ which can be falsified using deductive logic by observing at least one F that is not a G. However, it is impossible to gather enough observations to conclusively prove this hypothesis true. Popper also dismissed statements like ‘Some F’s are G’ as unimportant and rarely occurring in science (Ladyman, 2002). To sum up Popper’s attitude towards seeking truth within science, we can compare it to a sort of search for the Holy Grail where there are an infinite amount of unholy grails that all glow but could stop glowing at any time. The Holy Grail glows forever but you can only pick up and carry one at a time. The best you can do is to carry a grail until it stops glowing and then exchange it for a glowing one until the day you die, without knowing if you ever succeeded. Similarly, all we can do is adopt and test scientific theories until we have falsified them and then try another. All in all, in regards to the problem of induction, Popper bites the bullet and agrees with Hume that it is impossible to justify induction. However, Popper dismisses the need for induction within science and proposes his hypothetico-deductive model. Salmon vs. Popper While Popper has received critique on his principle of falsification, let us assume that we can use it to decisively reject theories and, instead, focus on rational theory choice. Popper runs into some serious trouble when it comes to rational prediction. As Popper has demonstrated, we are justified in dismissing falsified theories if we hope to deduce true predictions. Nonetheless, Salmon (1981) points out that “the exclusion of refuted generalizations does not, however, tell us what general premise should be employed” (p. 117). There is an infinite array of theories that are compatible with the available observational evidence that have not been refuted yet. To picture this problem, we can imagine a bridge that needs to be built which requires us to apply scientific theories to a practical task (Godfrey-Smith, 2021). Naturally, architects and engineers will resort to methods that have been used extensively in the past. However, we know that Popper would dismiss this inductive thinking as unjustified. But how, according to Popper, should we decide between a theory that has been tested many times and a completely new theory, both of which have not been falsified? As a response, Popper proposed the concept of ‘corroboration’ which is a sort of measurement of the past performance of a theory without making future predictions (Schilpp, 1974). Popper states that in instances like the bridge-building example, it is rational to choose the more corroborated theory. However, as Salmon (1981) points out, since corroboration holds no predictions with respect to future performance (otherwise it would be arguing inductively), it is impossible to make a rational choice between a theory that is corroborated and one that is not, given that neither is falsified. In a reply to Salmon, Watkins, Popper’s scholar, argued that between two mutually incompatible hypotheses, it would be rational for an agent to choose the better corroborated one since he has nothing else to go on (Salmon, 1981). This argument, however, appeals to a false premise since the agent does have other things to go on such as flipping a coin or choosing the hypothesis with the least characters. Indeed, taking Popper’s proposal seriously, “it is hard to see how corroboration can supply a rational basis for preference of a theory for purposes of practical prediction” (Salmon, 1981, p. 120). In numerous replies, Popper and Watkins have stuck to the view that corroboration has no predictive import, “although they motivate and justify our preference for some theory or other” (Schilpp, 1974, p. 1029-30). While corroboration may motivate an agent to choose one theory over another, it is difficult to see how this preference is justified. This distinction is of fundamental importance since Popper’s inability to provide a tenable account of rational prediction, given his dismissal of induction, we can hardly credit him with having solved the problem of induction. Conclusion Hume’s formulation of the problem of induction has proven to be the source of much debate for the past two hundred years and has helped us be more aware of how science should be done and is justified. As a result, Popper has drawn our attention to features of good science and encouraged critical thinking concerning established wisdom and using bold new conjectures to further scientific discovery as a whole. However, while Popper has provided some valuable contributions, his pure deductivism alone fails to do justice to the problem of rational predictions and the problem of induction in general. It seems that, as of yet, we cannot explain the scientific method and the justification of it without some form of induction inevitably seeping through.\"\n",
